<h3 align="left"><strong>General instructions for all assignments</strong></h3>
<p>For all questions submit your answer as well as the R code you used to produce your answer. Solutions to assignments must satisfy the following format. Your submission should consist of two parts with both parts contained in the same document. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The first part should consist of your answers to specific questions. This should include written answers to the individual questions as well as any figures, tables, and annotated output needed to justify your answers. Integrate output, graphs, and text in a single document. For R output pasted into your document use a non-proportional (typewriter) font such as <span class="courier">Courier</span> or <span class="courier">Courier New</span> to get the columns in the output to line up correctly. Graphics can be copied and pasted directly from the R graphics window, or saved first and then imported into your document. Do not intersperse your R code with the answers except in those cases where the R code itself is the answer to the question.</li>
  <li>The second part should consist of the R code  that you used to generate your results. The code should be complete enough so that someone else could enter your code at their computer without modification and obtain exactly the output you claim to have obtained. Don't include spurious or superfluous code. Ideally I should be able to paste the code you send me directly into my own R console window and get all of the results you report without error messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>I prefer that you submit your homework electronically as an email attachment. Your document may be in the form of an MS Word document (preferred), pdf, or some other formatted type (assuming I'm able to read it). Your solutions should be sent to me on or before the due date by ordinary <a href="mailto:jack_weiss@unc.edu">email</a> or via Sakai.</p>
