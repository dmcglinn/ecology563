  <h3 class="style10">Overview of the Course</h3>
  <p>This is a course in statistical modeling for ecologists. We focus on elementary statistical methods, primarily regression, and describe how they can be extended to make them more appropriate for analyzing ecological data. These extensions include using more realistic probability models (beyond the normal distribution) and accounting for situations in which  observations are not statistically independent. <span class="MsoNormal">For each model we consider we will see how to estimate it using both frequentist (when possible) and  Bayesian methods. Our emphasis here is on depth rather than breadth. (The other graduate course that I teach, ECOL 562, is a survey course that covers a wide range of statistical methods useful in environmental science. This course focuses on 40% of the material from that course but covers it in greater depth.) </span></p>
  <p><span class="MsoNormal">Familiarity with the standard parametric approaches of statistical analysis such as hypothesis testing is assumed. The course is intended to serve as a transition between what is typically taught in an undergraduate statistics course and what is actually needed to successfully analyze data in ecology and environmental sciences. The ideal enrollee is an upper level undergraduate  or beginning graduate student who has already taken an introductory statistics course and wishes to see the modern application of statistics to environmental science and ecology.</span></p>
  <h3 class="style10">Prerequisites</h3>
  <p>The prerequisites are modest, a one semester undergraduate or high school course in statistics 
    (the equivalent of  STOR 155  at UNC) and some exposure to the concepts of calculus. If you have never studied 
    statistics, this is probably not the course for you. I expect you to be familiar with (as in heard of and can quickly relearn)  the following 
    concepts: </p>


  <ol>
    <li>elementary probability theory including the notion of conditional probability and continuous and discrete random variables,</li>
    <li> the standard parametric approaches to hypothesis testing, e.g., one 
      and two-sample t-tests, etc., and</li>
    <li>elementary linear regression in which there is a single response and 
      a single predictor.</li>
  </ol>


  <p>Just about any elementary statistics text covers this material. The book 
    <i>Introduction to the Practice of Statistics</i> by David S. Moore and 
    George P. McCabe, the text that has been used in undergraduate statistics courses 
    at UNC, is an adequate choice as is any other text written at this level. 
    Classic texts for biologists that cover this material, plus a lot more, are  <em>Biostatistical Analysis</em> by Jerrold Zar and <i>Biometry</i> by Robert R. Sokal and F. James Rohlf. 
  </p>
<h3 class="style10">Statistical Software</h3>
  <p>No familiarity with statistical software is assumed. We will be using R, 
    an implementation of the S language, available for free download at 
    <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">http://cran.r-project.org</a>. The current version is R 2.11. R runs 
    on all major operating systems, including Windows, Unix, and Mac OS X. R 
    is a state-of-the-art modern statistical package actively supported by the 
    worldwide scientific community. It is not easy to use but it has become the de facto 
    standard for scientific research. </p>
  <p>For Bayesian estimation we will use WinBUGS, <span class="MsoNormal">downloadable for free from <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml">http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml</a>. WinBUGS is the most popular implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian estimation and has a large online support group. WinBUGS only runs on Windows but I have achieved good performance running WinBUGS on a Mac using VMWare Fusion to run Windows. An alternative to WinBUGS, especially for Macintosh users, is JAGS: <a href="http://www-ice.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/">http://www-ice.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/</a>. The modeling language of JAGS is nearly identical to that of WinBUGS. Both JAGS and WinBUGS can be called directly from R through the use of add-on packages, and this is how we will use them.</span></p>
  <p>You will need to install R and either WinBUGS or JAGS on your own laptop. It is recommended that you bring your laptop to class on Mondays. Typically our Monday (and occasional Wednesday) sessions will be devoted to carrying out analyses on real data using R and/or WinBUGS/JAGS. These analyses will then form the basis for that week's homework assignment. </p>
  <p class="style7warn" style='margin-left:.35in;text-indent:-.35in'>NB: Before coming to each  class you should check the course web site to see what data sets you should download and what R packages, if any, you should install!</p>
<h3 class="style10">Course Content </h3>
  <p>This is a course in regression and includes an extensive introduction into  one specific approach to the analysis of structured data, mixed effects models, from both a frequentist and Bayesian perspective. Our topics include the following.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Basic concepts in regression: continuous predictors, categorical predictors, and interactions</li>
    <li>Analyzing standard statistical designs with a continuous response: analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and split plot designs</li>
    <li>Bayesian approach to statistics</li>
    <li>Mixed effects models for analyzing structured data
      <ol type='a'>
        <li> Random intercepts and slopes models</li>
        <li> Multilevel models with 2 and 3 levels</li>
        <li> Hierarchical Bayesian modeling</li>
        <li>Nonlinear mixed effects models</li>
        <li>Models with nested and crossed random effects</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Likelihood theory and its application to regression</li>
    <li>Analysis of binomial data</li>
    <li>Analysis of count data: Poisson and negative binomial regression (both NB1 and NB2); ZIP models</li></ol>
