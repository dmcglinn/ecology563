# ecology563
A backup of Jack Wiess's "Statistical Methods in Ecology" course

Course url: https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/3d1eb92e-7848-4f55-90c3-7c72a54e7e43/public/index.html

This repo is intended as a backup if UNC ever decides to take Jack's course offline

I created this snapshot with the follwing command
`wget -r --level=2 -k -p https://sakai.unc.edu/access/content/group/3d1eb92e-7848-4f55-90c3-7c72a54e7e43/public/index.html`
